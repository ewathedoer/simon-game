# Simon Game
The Simon Game is a memory game where a user has to listen and repeat the pattern of 20 sounds to win.

[Live preview](http://theonewhodo.es/simon-game/) 

The app has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when being pressed. A user is presented with a set of random sounds. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. 

If a user wins, there is the time for _victory beat_ and the game restarts to a single step. If a mistake is made, the user is notified and the pattern gets repeated. While playing in a strict mode, after a mistake the game restarts to a single step.  A user can always change the mode while playing. 

The info area displays a step number, notifications and a toggle allowing restart. The notifications are dynamicaly displayed depending on the turn and the previous move.
